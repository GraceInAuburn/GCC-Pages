Grace can seem like a big place until you find <em>your</em> place - friends who know you and live life with you. There are many ways you can grow in your connectedness to God and others here. Sundays are a start. You may attend services, attend a class or choose to serve in one of a variety of ministries. Many ministries meet during the week. We also have a growing network of small groups.
